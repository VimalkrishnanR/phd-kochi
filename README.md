### Lede Program - Project 2 

## Overview

Project webpage: [Through the Tomes of Shodhganga: The Queen of the Arabian Sea as a 'Subject' of Research](https://vimalkrishnanr.github.io/phd-kochi/)

In this project, I am offering a brief data-visual interpretation of the Greek and Roman art collections held by the Cleveland Musuem of Art (CMA). The CMA, opened in 1916, is celebrating its 110th anniversary this year. In my story I discuss how CMA's early identity was forged by a classical Greco-Roman aesthetic. In this context, my story visualises data related to the current Greek and Roman art collection held by the CMA. 

## Data Collection Process 
The primary source of my data is the open access api offered by the CMA. Data is available in CSV, Json, and API formats here:
https://openaccess-api.clevelandart.org/
https://github.com/ClevelandMuseumArt/openaccess

As I focused on the Greek and Roman Art department, I used the official name of the department (Appendix B - API documentation) as a filter in the 'department' parameter to narrow down the scope of the json data. Using Requests, I imported the json data (refer to the notebook Cleveland.ipynb in the 'analysis' directory) into a pandas dataframe. 

## Data Analysis Process

Some of the primary questions that I wanted to answer are as follows: 
1. What is the overall current composition of the Greek and Roman Art Department, at CMA? 
2. What are the different types of artworks held by the department? 
3. What are they made out of? 
4. Exhibition and Citation history: 
 - 4.1: Compared to other departments, how widely have artworks in the Greek and Roman Art Department been exhibited? 
 - 4.2: Which is the most cited and most exhibited artwork within the Greek and Roman Art Department and within the museum's entire collection?
 - 4.3: Which are the artworks, currently held by Greek and Roman art Department, that constituted the exhibits in the inaugural exhibition?

To allow for deeper practice with pandas, I streamlined the scope of the project. I focused on questions 1, 2, 3, and 4.3. 

The data analysis involved identifying the categories/columns that were relevant for my questions and making subsets of the dataframe. I used the pandas package for casting the json data into a dataframe. By filtering relevand columns, I did further analysis like value counts (for pictogram) and cross tabulations (for sankey chart). To make a list of artworks that were exhibited in the inaugural exhibition, I filtered the  'exhibition' column by applying the string value 'Inaugural Exhibition'.

## Skills learnt 
This project has been an enriching experience. I could refine my technical skills in the application of python, pandas, HTML, CSS, and data visualisation tools like Flourish. I also learnt how data analysis and visualisations work best when they complement an overarching narrative.

## Tools used
 -  Python and various Python pacakges
 -  Jupyter Notebooks
 -  VS code
 -  Flourish

## Future Work
I hope to return to this project to do deeper analysis in pandas and to design a website that is more visual and interactive. I also plan to explore libaries like D3, three.js and and further develop my graphic and web design skills.
